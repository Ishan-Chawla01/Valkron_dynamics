# Valkron_dynamics
This repository deals with the **AI-ML model work for Valkron dynamics**. It specifically deals and operates with **yolo model family**. <br> It uses **Python, jupyter notebooks and google collab powered notebooks** for results.
## Ishan's current work
My current work deals with civilian vehicles which's code I will be posting here. Its few characteristics are:
+ Uses yolov8n (previously) and yolov5s (now) for image classification
+ Relies on **VisDrone dataset** for data collection
+ Is heavily skewed in favour of one class (cars).
Looking forward to working with you
