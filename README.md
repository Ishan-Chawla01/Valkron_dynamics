# Valkron_dynamics
This repository deals with the **AI-ML model work for Valkron dynamics**. It specifically deals and operates with **yolo model family**. <br> It uses **Python, jupyter notebooks and google collab powered notebooks** for results.
## Ishan's current work
My current work deals with civilian vehicles which's code I will be posting here. Its few characteristics are:
+ Uses yolov8n (previously) and yolov5s (now) for image classification
+ Relies on **VisDrone dataset** for data collection
+ Is heavily skewed in favour of one class (cars).
Looking forward to working with you
## Sungjay work:
+ My current work is to detect miliary vehicle along with some civilian vehicles. For this I am using Arma-dataset where there is label for 3 military vehicles namely marid,zamak and varsuk. But during testing the training model there are misclassification of civilian vehicles as marid,zamak and varsuk
+ How to resolve them? One way is to have more labels for civilian vehicles like car, tractor and so on. For that I used makesense.ai or google aiâ€™s to label them.
+ But due to lack of civilian vehicles in dataset, the model is prone to overfitting. For resolving that I am currently working with generation of synthetic dataset
